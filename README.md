# Some-principal-aspects-of-statistical-mechanics-of-multiplex-networks

This project was realized by 

**Juan C Higuera C**

**Diego A Heredia F**

And was presented for the course **Introduction To Sociophysics** of the National University of Colombia.

In this work we review the formalism of **statistical mechanics** of **multiplex networks**.

Statistical Mechanics, in particular the principle of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) is a useful tool to build a ensemble of random networks with some preselected properties. This null hypothesis network allows us to characterize the properties of a network implicit in some of its topological attributes.
